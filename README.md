# FFPopSim-with-migration
We here present a module that can perform a migration between two FFPopSim subpopulations, with specified migration rate, using the FFPopSim library. It needs to be ran each time the two populations evolve by 1 step on their own by other mean such as recombination, mutation etc. It can be used for both the 'lowd' and the 'highd' classes
